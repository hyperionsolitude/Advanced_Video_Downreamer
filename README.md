### Building from Source

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hyperionsolitude/Advanced_Video_Downreamer.git
   cd Advanced_Video_Downreamer
   ```

2. **Open in Android Studio**
   - Launch Android Studio
   - Open the project folder
   - Wait for Gradle sync to complete

3. **Run Quality Checks (Optional)**
   ```bash
   # Sort imports and run all QA checks
   ./scripts/sort_imports.sh
   
   # Or run individual checks
   ./gradlew detekt ktlintMainSourceSetCheck lintDebug
   ```

4. **Build and Install**
   ```bash
   ./gradlew assembleDebug
   ./gradlew installDebug
   ```

### APK Installation
Download the latest APK from the [Releases](https://github.com/hyperionsolitude/Advanced_Video_Downreamer/releases) page and install on your Android device.

## üîÑ CI/CD Pipeline

This project uses GitHub Actions for automated quality assurance and builds:

### Quality Assurance Workflow
- **Detekt**: Static code analysis for Kotlin
- **KtLint**: Code style and formatting checks
- **Android Lint**: Android-specific code analysis
- **Import Sorting**: Automatic import organization (via `scripts/sort_imports.sh`)

### Build Workflow
- **Unit Tests**: Automated test execution (if present)
- **Debug APK**: Build and upload debug APK
- **Release APK**: Build and upload release APK
- **Artifact Upload**: Test results and QA reports

### Workflow Triggers
- Push to `main` or `develop` branches
- Pull requests to `main` or `develop` branches
- Manual workflow dispatch

### Retrieving APKs from GitHub Actions
- Open the latest workflow run under the **Actions** tab
- Scroll to the bottom of the run summary to the **Artifacts** section
- Download:
  - `debug-apks` for all generated debug APKs (handles variant/universal names)
  - `release-apks` for all generated release APKs
- If no artifacts appear, re-run the job and ensure the build completed successfully

### Local QA Shortcuts
```bash
# Auto-format imports and verify ktlint
./scripts/sort_imports.sh

# Run individual checks
./gradlew detekt ktlintMainSourceSetCheck lintDebug

# Build APKs
./gradlew assembleDebug assembleRelease
```

## üöÄ Usage

### Basic Usage

1. **Enter URL**: Input a direct file URL or directory URL
2. **Fetch Files**: Tap "üîç Fetch Files" to discover available files
3. **Select Files**: Check the files you want to download
4. **Start Download**: Tap "üì• Download Selected" to begin downloads
5. **Monitor Progress**: Watch real-time progress and status updates

### Advanced Features

#### Directory Browsing
- Enter a directory URL (e.g., `https://example.com/videos/`)
- The app will scan for downloadable files
- Filter results using the search box

#### Batch Operations
- **Select All**: Use "Select All" to choose all files
- **Invert Selection**: Toggle selection of all files
- **Clear Selection**: Deselect all files

#### Storage Management
- **Change Storage**: Tap "Change Storage" to select download location
- **Storage Info**: View available space and current storage location

#### File Streaming
- **Stream Single File (Downloaded)**: Select a downloaded file and tap "‚ñ∂Ô∏è Stream". The app creates a temporary single-item M3U playlist with the correct title to ensure proper display in VLC.
- **Stream Mixed Selection**: Select both downloaded and network files; the app generates an M3U playlist that:
  - Uses `file://` absolute paths for downloaded items
  - Uses direct URLs for network items
  - Includes titles via `#EXTINF` and VLC `#EXTVLCOPT` directives for consistent titles
- The app prefers VLC for playlists. For single files, your preferred player may be offered.

### Permissions
- The app uses Android **FileProvider** and the **Storage Access Framework (SAF)**
- On first external/SD-card access, you'll be prompted to grant folder access
- If titles display as "unknown" in VLC, ensure the chosen folder has read permissions and try re-opening VLC (some devices refresh titles after screen unlock)

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Language**: Kotlin
- **UI Framework**: Android Views with Material Design Components
- **Architecture Pattern**: MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)
- **Async Operations**: Kotlin Coroutines
- **File Management**: Android FileProvider API

### Key Components
- **MainActivity**: Main UI and download orchestration
- **FileAdapter**: RecyclerView adapter for file list display
- **MainViewModel**: Business logic and data management
- **DownloadFile**: Data model for file information
- **FileUtils**: Utility functions for file operations
- **PlaylistCreator**: Builds M3U playlists for single/multiple items
- **Streamer**: Handles streaming logic, local/network fallbacks, and player intents

### Performance Optimizations
- **Throttled UI Updates**: Progress updates limited to prevent UI lag
- **Targeted View Updates**: Only progress bars update, not entire list items
- **Efficient Memory Usage**: Proper cleanup of resources and handlers
- **Background Processing**: Downloads run on background threads

## üìã Supported File Types

### Primary Focus - Video Formats
- **MP4, MKV, AVI, MOV, WMV, FLV, WebM** - Main video formats

### Secondary Support - Audio Formats
- **MP3, WAV, FLAC, AAC, OGG, M4A** - Audio files for playlists

### Additional Support
- **PDF** - Document files
- **ZIP, RAR, 7Z** - Archive files

*Note: While the app supports multiple file types, it's primarily optimized for video file downloads and streaming.*

## üîß Configuration

### Storage Settings
- **Default Location**: Downloads folder
- **Custom Location**: Choose any accessible directory
- **SD Card Support**: Full external storage support

### Download Settings
- **Concurrent Downloads**: Multiple files download simultaneously
- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry on network errors
- **Progress Updates**: Real-time progress tracking

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Downloads not starting**
- Check internet connection
- Verify URL is accessible
- Ensure storage permissions are granted

**Files not appearing**
- Verify the URL points to a directory or file
- Check if the server allows directory listing
- Try refreshing the file list

**Storage issues**
- Ensure sufficient storage space
- Check storage permissions
- Try changing download location

**Streaming plays from network instead of local**
- Ensure the file is fully downloaded; the app tolerates a small size delta
- Confirm the local path exists and is readable
- For SD card, reselect the folder via SAF when prompted

**VLC shows "unknown" title**
- Re-open the stream; titles are injected via M3U and may refresh on unlock
- Make sure VLC has storage permission and the playlist was re-generated recently

**App crashes**
- Restart the app
- Clear app data if necessary
- Check Android version compatibility
